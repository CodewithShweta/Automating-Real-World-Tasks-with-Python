## WEEK 1
Manipulating Images (scale_image.py)

Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

# What you’ll do

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

Open an image

Rotate an image

Resize an image

Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory
